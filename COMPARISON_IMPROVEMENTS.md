# SONA Comparison Feature Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced SONA's comparison capabilities to handle category-based comparisons including internal/external tools and functional categories.

## What Was Added

### 1. Compare All Internal Tools
Users can now ask SONA to compare all internal (Sanofi) tools:
- "Compare all internal tools"
- "Compare internal tools"
- "Compare all Sanofi tools"
- "Compare in-house tools"

### 2. Compare All External Tools
Users can now ask SONA to compare all external (third-party) tools:
- "Compare all external tools"
- "Compare external tools"
- "Compare third-party tools"
- "Compare public tools"

### 3. Enhanced Category Comparisons
SONA now recognizes more categories and includes the `modules` field in searches:
- **Productivity tools**: "Compare productivity tools"
- **Collaboration tools**: "Compare collaboration tools"
- **Analytics tools**: "Compare analytics tools"
- **Document tools**: "Compare document tools"
- **Code/Programming tools**: "Compare coding tools" or "Compare programming tools"
- **Creative tools**: "Compare creative tools" or "Compare design tools"
- **Data tools**: "Compare data tools"
- **Research tools**: "Compare research tools"
- **Medical tools**: "Compare medical tools"
- And many more...

### 4. Improved Comparison Display
When comparing categories, SONA now:
- Shows the number of tools found in the category
- Displays internal vs external badge for each tool
- Includes technology information when available
- Provides helpful follow-up suggestions
- No longer limits category comparisons to just 3 tools (shows ALL matching tools)
