## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Key Changes

1. **Async Translation Function**
   - Made `generateIntelligentResponse()` async
   - Returns `Promise<string>` instead of `string`
   - Updated all call sites with `await`

2. **Free MyMemory API Integration**
   ```typescript
   async function translateWithAPI(
     text: string,
     targetLang: LanguageCode,
     sourceLang: LanguageCode = 'en'
   ): Promise<string | null>
   ```

3. **Three-Tier Strategy**
   ```typescript
   async function translateTextWithAPI(
     text: string, 
     targetLang: LanguageCode, 
     sourceLang: LanguageCode = 'en'
   ): Promise<{ 
     translation: string, 
     isKnown: boolean, 
     method: 'dictionary' | 'api' | 'deepl' | 'unavailable' 
   }>
   ```

### API Details

**MyMemory Translation API:**
- Endpoint: `https://api.mymemory.translated.net/get`
- Method: GET
- No authentication required
- Free tier: 1,000 words/day per IP
- Response format:
  ```json
  {
    "responseData": {
      "translatedText": "Bonjour"
    }
  }
  ```
