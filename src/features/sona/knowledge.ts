// Top 10 AI Facts
export function getTop10AIFacts(): string {
  return `## 🧠 Top 10 AI Facts You Should Know

**1. AI is Older Than You Think** 🕰️
The term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference. Modern AI's roots go back nearly 70 years!

**2. AI Learns Like Humans (Sort Of)** 🎓
Machine learning mimics how our brains create neural pathways. AI models learn from examples, make mistakes, and improve over time—just like us!

**3. AI Can Be Biased** ⚖️
AI systems learn from data created by humans, so they can inherit our biases. That's why Sanofi emphasizes responsible AI practices!

**4. ChatGPT Has 175 Billion Parameters** 🤯
GPT-3, the model behind ChatGPT, has 175 billion parameters (think of them as "knowledge nodes"). That's more than the number of stars in the Milky Way!

**5. AI Can't Actually "Understand"** 🤔
Despite seeming intelligent, AI doesn't truly understand context like humans do. It recognizes patterns and predicts likely responses.

**6. AI Energy Consumption is Massive** ⚡
Training large AI models can use as much energy as 100 US homes consume in a year. Sustainability in AI is becoming critical!

**7. AI Hallucinations Are Real** 👻
AI can confidently generate false information that sounds plausible—called "hallucinations." Always verify AI outputs!

**8. AI in Healthcare is Revolutionary** 🏥
AI can analyze medical images faster than doctors, predict disease progression, and help discover new drugs—exactly what Sanofi is doing!

**9. Most AI is "Narrow AI"** 🎯
Today's AI excels at specific tasks (narrow AI) but can't generalize like humans. "General AI" that matches human intelligence doesn't exist yet!

**10. AI is a Tool, Not Magic** 🔧
Despite the hype, AI is ultimately a powerful tool that requires human judgment, creativity, and oversight to use effectively!
